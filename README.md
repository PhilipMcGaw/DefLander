# DefLander

This is inspired by the [ToyLander](https://www.toylander.com/), but is engineered to be four wheel drive, and usable in [HackyRacing](http://hackyracers.co.uk/)/[PRS](http://powerracingseries.org/), the DefLander is based on the looks of a Series 2 Landrover, the dimensions come from the 2019 PRS and 2019 UK Hacky Racer Rules:

## Physical design constraints


### § 1.4. Car Size of 2019 PRS Rules for the Terminally Humourless
* Each car shall not be longer than 62”
* Each car shall not be wider than 36”
* Each car, including the driver seated and dressed per the rules, shall not be taller than 72”

### § 1.7 Motor Propulsion, § 1.8. Battery, § 1.13.6. Fuse

* Each motor must have a maximum RMS input voltage not greater than 48V from the motor controller.
* Each car shall have at least one battery with a nominal voltage less than or equal to 48V that supplies traction current to the controller and motor
* 48V = 30A (10S - 12S Lipo) (Digikey #F7139-ND BF1 series)
* 36V = 40A (8S - 9S Lipo) (Digikey #F3089-ND MIDI series
 OR Digikey #F6792-ND BF1 series)

### § 1.13.3. Brakes

* Brakes are required safety systems.
* Each car shall have mechanical brakes capable of stopping the car in full per Rule 4.1.1.2 (At the end of the hot lap, your car will have to come to a complete stop within 6m of when its transponder crossed the start/finish line.)
* Brakes that apply braking force directly to the tyre of a car are not allowed to be the only source of mechanical braking.
* Brakes that apply braking force to the ground are not allowed.
### Other constraints

* Bob's big CNC machine has a 4' x 4' (1200 x 1200 mm) cutting bed.
